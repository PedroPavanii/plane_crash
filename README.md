## Conclusion:
The analysis of aviation accidents revealed an increase in incidents during the 1940s due to World War II, followed by a decrease in accidents after the establishment of the FAA in 1958. A remarkable 85.3% reduction in accidents was observed from the early 2000s to 2022, attributed to advancements in on-board technologies, automated approach to landing, and improved weather forecasting. The study focused on accidents within military institutions, identifying the Mitsubishi aircraft as having the highest chance of death and the Grumann aircraft as having the lowest. Notably, the Cessna 208 demonstrated the best survival rate in accidents, while the A320 had the worst. The FAA implemented intensified training and increased inspections for the Mitsubishi MU-2 aircraft as an improvement project. Additionally, the introduction of the Airbus A321neo, with enhanced fuel economy and technological advancements, has prompted airlines to modernize their fleets. The analysis indicated a rise in the number of flights over the years alongside a decrease in accidents, resulting in a significantly lower accident rate when comparing flights and accidents. Utilizing the Linear Regression model, the study achieved an accuracy of 62%, an AUC curve of 62%, and a recall rate of 75% for a worst-case scenario false positive. However, the model exhibited limitations in predicting survival probabilities accurately, and more data is required to establish precise probabilities, as the existing dataset may be influenced by war-related fatalities. The model's inability to predict probabilities effectively implies a reliance on chance rather than a reliable risk assessment tool. Overall, the findings of the study, highlighting the decline in accidents, advancements in technology, and safety measures, aim to alleviate concerns about flying. However, further research, data collection, and modeling improvements are necessary to enhance the accuracy and reliability of survival probability predictions in future accidents.

I hope I helped someone with this project as many people helped me! Hugs to you who read!
